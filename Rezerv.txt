"U_FIGHTER_Carrier_NAME" LANG "Carrier fighter"
"U_FIGHTER_DESC" LANG "A fighter aircraft is a military fixed-wing aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft. The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and maneuverability relative to the target aircraft.\n\nThe fighter's main tactical purpose is to establish air superiority over the battlefield.\n\n\n+ Great speed and maneuverability.\n+ Heavy Air-to-Air armament.\n+ Can carry ALBMs.\n- Short range.\n- Limited use against surface targets."
"U_FIGHTER_NAME" LANG "Fighter"

"U_Mobile_MRBM_NAME" LANG "Missile vehicle"
"U_Mobile_SAM_DESC" LANG "Anti-aircraft weapon systems installed on the mobile platform, so it can be repositioned to strengthen the air defence where required.\n\n\n+ Can reposition anywhere inside your territory.\n- More expensive to build than the fixed SAM site."
"U_Mobile_SAM_NAME" LANG "Mobile SAM"
"U_Nuclear_Submarine_DESC" LANG "A ballistic missile submarine is a submarine capable of deploying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads.\n\n These submarines became a major weapon system in the Cold War because of their nuclear deterrence capability. They can fire missiles thousands of kilometers from their targets, and acoustic quieting makes them difficult to detect, thus making them a survivable deterrent in the event of a first strike and a key element of the mutual assured destruction policy of nuclear deterrence.\n\n\n+ Carries Nuclear weapons (SLBMs).\n- Can launch missiles only when surfaced.\n- Limited defence capabilities."
"U_Nuclear_Submarine_NAME" LANG "SSBN"
"U_Over_horizon_radar_DESC" LANG "Загоризонтный радар, или ЗГРЛС, представляет собой тип радиолокационной системы, способной обнаруживать цели на очень больших расстояниях, за пределами радиолокационного горизонта, что является пределом дальности для обычного радара.\n\nОсновная роль заключается в обнаружении приближающихся вражеских ракет задолго до того, как они достигнут вашей территории, чтобы у вашей противоракетной обороны было время их перехватить.\n\n\n+ Чрезвычайно большая дальность обнаружения ракет.\n+Точно вычисляет источник запуска.\n- Обнаруживает только баллистические ракеты."

"U_SUBMARINE_DESC" LANG "A submarine (or sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater.\nAlthough experimental submarines had been built before, submarine design took off during the 19th century, and they were adopted by several navies. Submarines were first widely used during World War I (1914–1918), and are now used in many navies large and small. Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships (merchant and military), or other submarines, aircraft carrier protection, blockade running and reconnaissance.\n\n\n+ Can sneak past the enemy's defences.\n- Limited attack possibilities."
